Configure your animation settings using the Animation Settings options before importing.

You can also use the Show Animation Clips feature to manage multiple animation clips, which are automatically organized in Maya's Time Editor.</p> How do I handle material variants? <p>Material variants are supported through the Show Material Variants feature.

By default (when \"Use Relative Path\" is unchecked), textures are saved to your Maya project's sourceimages directory (e.g., <code>C:\\Users\\{User name}\\Documents\\maya\\projects\\default\\sourceimages\\gltf_textures</code>). When \"Use Relative Path\" is enabled, textures are saved relative to the GLB file location, which is useful for portable project structures.</p> </li> <li> <p>GLTF files: Extraction is not needed because textures are external files. The texture image paths will be set relative to the GLTF file location automatically.</p> </li> </ul> How do I handle PBR materials? <p>The plugin converts PBR (Physically Based Rendering) materials to Maya-compatible materials. You can choose from multiple shader types:</p> <ul> <li>Standard Surface (default): Best for general use with Arnold and other renderers</li> <li>Arnold: Optimized for Arnold renderer workflows</li> <li>OpenPBR (Maya 2025+): Industry-standard PBR shader, though Arnold may not render all properties correctly</li> <li>Stingray: Legacy option, only supports basic material properties (BaseColor, ORM, Normal, Emissive)</li> </ul> <p>Additionally, you can enable \"Import Ambient Occlusion\" to import AO from ORM texture (R channel) and multiply it with base color for enhanced depth and shadow detail.
