## üé® Supported Shaders

The plugin supports conversion to the following Maya shader types:

- **Standard Surface** - Maya's standard physically-based shader
- **AiStandardSurface** - Arnold renderer's standard surface shader
- **OpenPBR** - Open-source physically-based rendering shader
- **StingrayPBS** - Stingray physically-based shader (only basic material properties: BaseColor, ORM, Normal, Emissive)

## üñºÔ∏è Supported Image Formats

The plugin can process the following image formats for textures:

- **JPEG** (`.jpg`, `.jpeg`) - Compressed raster images
- **PNG** (`.png`) - Lossless compressed raster images with transparency support

## üìã Compatibility Notes

- Extension support may vary depending on your Maya version and installed renderers
- Shader support depends on the renderers available in your Maya installation
- Image format support follows Maya's native texture loading capabilities
