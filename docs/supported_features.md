# Supported Features

This page provides a comprehensive overview of all file formats, extensions, shaders, and image formats supported by the glTF/glb Importer for Maya plugin.

---

## Supported File Types

The plugin supports the following glTF file formats:

- **glTF** (`.gltf`) - JSON-based 3D scene format
- **glb** (`.glb`) - Binary glTF format with embedded resources

---

## Supported Extensions

The plugin supports the following Khronos and vendor extensions:

**Note:** The implementation status of extensions varies. Some extensions are fully supported, while others may be partially implemented or have known limitations. Please test your specific use case and refer to the [limitations documentation](limitations.md) for details.

If you encounter any issues with specific extensions, please [open an issue](https://github.com/username/repo/issues) with details about your use case and sample files. This helps us improve support for partially implemented extensions.

| `KHR_materials_ior` | Index of refraction for materials |
| `KHR_materials_iridescence` | Iridescent material effects |
| `KHR_materials_sheen` | Fabric-like sheen material properties |
| `KHR_materials_specular` | Specular workflow materials |
| `KHR_materials_transmission` | Light transmission through materials |
| `KHR_materials_unlit` | Unlit/constant color materials |
| `KHR_materials_variants` | Multiple material variants per mesh |
| `KHR_materials_volume` | Transmission volume material properties |
| `KHR_mesh_quantization` | Reduced precision vertex attributes for smaller file sizes |
| `KHR_texture_transform` | Texture coordinate transformations |

### Vendor Extensions (EXT_)

| Extension | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| `EXT_mesh_gpu_instancing` | GPU-based mesh instancing |

## Supported Shaders

The plugin supports conversion to the following Maya shader types:

- **Standard Surface** - Maya's standard physically-based shader
- **AiStandardSurface** - Arnold renderer's standard surface shader
- **OpenPBR** - Open-source physically-based rendering shader
- **StingrayPBS** - Stingray physically-based shader (only basic material properties: BaseColor, ORM, Normal, Emissive)

---

## Supported Image Formats

The plugin can process the following image formats for textures:

- **JPEG** (`.jpg`, `.jpeg`) - Compressed raster images
- **PNG** (`.png`) - Lossless compressed raster images with transparency support

---

## Compatibility Notes

- Extension support may vary depending on your Maya version and installed renderers
- Shader support depends on the renderers available in your Maya installation
