# UI Options

The UI Options section provides settings to customize the user interface behavior when importing GLTF/GLB files.

## Dock Material and Animation UIs by default

Controls whether the Material and Animation UI panels are automatically docked when the importer is opened:

- When enabled, the Material and Animation UIs will be docked to the Maya interface by default
- When disabled (default), the UI panels will appear as floating windows
- This setting is useful for users who prefer a more integrated workspace layout
- The docked state persists for the current Maya session
