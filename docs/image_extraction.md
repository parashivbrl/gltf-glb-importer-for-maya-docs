# Image Extraction

When importing glTF/GLB files, you can choose where the extracted texture maps are saved by using the "Use Relative Path" checkbox option.

## Texture Map Save Locations

### Use Relative Path Unchecked (Default)
When the "Use Relative Path" checkbox is **unchecked**, images will be saved in the default Maya sourceimages directory:

```
C:\Users\{User name}\Documents\maya\projects\default\sourceimages\gltf_textures
```

### Use Relative Path Checked
When the "Use Relative Path" checkbox is **checked**, texture maps will be saved relative to the location of the imported glTF/GLB files.

This option is useful when you want to keep your textures organized alongside your model files or when working with portable project structures.
