# Dependencies Installation

This guide will help you install the required dependencies for the glTF/GLB importer plugin to work properly with Maya.

---

## üìã System Requirements

| Requirement | Details |
|-------------|---------|
| **Maya Version** | Maya 2022 or later (Python 3 support required) |
| **Operating System** | Windows, macOS, or Linux |
| **Python** | Python 3.7+ (automatically included with Maya 2022+) |

---

## üì¶ Required Dependencies

The plugin requires the following Python packages:

- **[pygltflib](https://pypi.org/project/pygltflib/)** - Core library for glTF/GLB file handling
- **[numpy](https://pypi.org/project/numpy/)** - Required for Maya 2024 and earlier versions only

> **Note:** Maya 2025+ includes numpy by default, so you only need to install pygltflib.

   ```

3. **Install pygltflib (may require sudo)**
   ```
   sudo ./mayapy -m pip install pygltflib
   ```

4. **Install numpy (Maya 2024 and earlier only)**
   ```
   sudo ./mayapy -m pip install numpy
   ```

## ‚úÖ Verifying Installation

After installation, you can verify that the dependencies are properly installed:

1. **Open Maya**
2. **Open the Script Editor** (Windows ‚Üí General Editors ‚Üí Script Editor)
3. **Run the following Python code** inside the Python tab (Not MEL tab):
   ```python
   try:
       import pygltflib
       print("‚úÖ pygltflib successfully imported")
   except ImportError:
       print("‚ùå pygltflib not found")
   
   try:
       import numpy
       print("‚úÖ numpy successfully imported")
   except ImportError:
       print("‚ùå numpy not found")
   ```
You should see the following two lines in the script editor's output:
```
‚úÖ pygltflib successfully imported
‚úÖ numpy successfully imported
```

## üîß Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Problem:** `mayapy` command not found
- **Solution:** Make sure you're in the correct Maya bin directory and that Maya is properly installed

**Problem:** Permission denied on Linux/macOS
- **Solution:** Try using `sudo` before the command

**Problem:** pip not found
- **Solution:** Maya's pip might need to be installed first:
  ```
  ./mayapy -m ensurepip --upgrade
  ```

### Getting Help

If you encounter issues:

1. Check that you're using the correct Maya version path
2. Ensure Maya is completely closed during installation
3. Try running Maya as administrator (Windows) or with sudo (Linux/macOS)
4. Verify your Maya installation includes Python 3 support
